# ðŸ“Š Ride-Hailing Data Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of a ride-hailing dataset, offering key insights into operational performance, customer and driver behavior, revenue streams, and service reliability. The analysis is conducted using Python with the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries, and the findings are visualized through a series of interactive dashboards.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
The core objective of this project is to transform raw ride-hailing data into actionable business intelligence. By analyzing various metrics, we can identify trends, pinpoint areas for improvement, and inform strategic decisions for a ride-hailing service.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handles missing values and data type conversions prepare the dataset for analysis.

- Interactive Dashboards: Visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) through a series of charts and graphs.

- Date Range Filtering: Allows for analysis of data within a specific time frame to track trends over time.

### Overall Summary

Booking Status Breakdown: A pie chart showing the distribution of ride statuses (Completed, Cancelled, Incomplete, etc.).

Total Bookings & Ride Volume: Key metrics highlighting the total number of bookings and completed rides.

#### Vehicle Types
Distribution of Vehicle Types: A bar chart showing the popularity of different vehicle types (e.g., Auto, Go Mini, eBike).

#### Revenue
Revenue by Payment Method: A bar chart illustrating total revenue generated from each payment method (e.g., UPI, Cash, Debit Card).

Ride Distance vs. Booking Value: A scatter plot to analyze the relationship between the distance of a ride and its associated cost.

#### Cancellations

Cancellation Overview: Pie charts and bar plots that break down the reasons for both customer and driver cancellations.

Cancelled Rides Overview: A pie chart summarizing the proportion of rides canceled by customers versus drivers.

Ratings
Average Ratings: A bar chart comparing the average driver and customer ratings across different vehicle types.
